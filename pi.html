                                                        Jonathan Nagler is Professor of Politics at New York University.
He received his AB in government from Harvard University
in 1982, and his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1989.  He has been a visiting
associate professor at Caltech and Harvard, and has taught at the
Summer Program, European Consortium for Political Research, Essex
University, England, and the Summer Program, Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research, University of Michigan,
as well as the ESRC Oxford Spring School in Quantitative Methods for
Social Research.  In 2012 Professor Nagler was a Fernand Braudel Fellow
at the European University Institute. Professor Nagler's research
focuses on voting and elections.<br><br>

Professor Nagler published a series of articles, co-authored with
R. Michael Alvarez, on multiple-candidate elections that have examined
the relative importance of issues and the state of the economy to
voters.  Professor Nagler's work on strategic voting in British
elections (with R. Michael Alvarez) won the 1998 Durr award.  Over the
last 18 years he has also published a series of papers with Jan
E. Leighley on the factors influencing voter turnout in the United
States. They have just completed a book on voter turnout in the
United States from 1972 to 2008.  Professor Nagler has also published
articles on the voting behavior of Latinos and women.<br><br>

Professor Nagler is currently working on the impact of economic
conditions on voting in presidential elections, and the impact of
California's Top 2 Election law.<br><br>

Professor Nagler's work has been supported by several grants from the
National Science Foundation.  In addition to his research, he
established the world wide web site of the Political Methodology
Section of the American Political Science Association, and served as
president of the association from 2001-2003. Professor Nagler is a
former editor of The Political Methodologist.  An estimator he developed
for the study of voter turnout, Scobit, is incorporated in the STATA
statistical package.  He is an Inaugural Fellow of the Society for
Political methodology.<br><br>

Professor Nagler has served as an expert witness on court casees on
primary reform and election law, and has consulted for presidential
campaigns and media surveys.  Nagler has appeared as a guest or been
interviewed on CNN, MTV, and Fox-News, as well as National Public Radio.

                                           <small>Rich Bonneau is an Associate Professor of Biology and Computer Science at NYU. Professor Bonneau's  laboratory is focused on two areas in computational and systems biology: 1) Predicting and designing protein and peptidomimetic structure and 2) Learning dynamic network models automatically from functional genomics data using scalable methods.<br><br>

In both research areas Professor Bonneau has played key roles in achieving critical field-wide milestones. In the area of structure prediction he was one of the early authors on the Rosetta code, which was one of the first codes to demonstrate accurate and comprehensive ability to predict protein structure in the absence of detectable sequence homology to proteins with known structures. His  lab continues to be a core contributor to the Rosetta research community, participating in the recent refactoring of the code and adding several new functionalities.<br><br>

Professor Bonneau's lab has also made key contributions to the area of genomics data analysis in a systems-biology context.  His lab  focuses on developing new methods for network inference that simultaneously learn dynamics and topology from data (the Inferelator), and methods that learn condition-dependent co-regulated gene groups from integrations of different genomics data- types (e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic, etc.) using approaches we have developed (cMonkey and multi-species-cMonkey integrative biclustering). In the DREAM3 and DREAM4 blind assessment of network inference methods they were top performers in the network inference category, and are currently contributing to a joint paper resulting from DREAM5 (the most current assessment of network inference methods).
